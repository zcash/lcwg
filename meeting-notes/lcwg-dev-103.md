### Agenda: 

- Transparent data in compact block model: current work work and next steps  
  - This could be carried out in both LWD and Zaino? Kris will Ask Larry if he can implement this in Go.  
    - Pacu could collaborate on delivering this in zaino  
  - ZIP editors should allocate time to update ZIP-307   
  - What’s the delta between the compact block data with or without transparent data? Shall a new RPC be created in order not to clog old clients?   
    - Pacu should do this measurement   
  - Are there any fingerprinting vectors because of the ability to request specific pools?  
    - Not really given at the moment requesting individual Transparent data points is much worse.  
- Zaino replace LightWalletd:  what’s missing? How can we collaborate best to get it done?  
  - There are not many things pending. We’ll make a laundry list of it to track it and develop it.
